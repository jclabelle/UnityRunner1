# What this is
A prototype mobile-style runner game with a light farm building layer built in Unity I wrote in 2022. This is my first 3D project.

# Context
My main goals were to learn the basic concepts needed to make a 3D game in Unity: character controllers, chase & isometric cameras, user interfaces, physics, action game gameplay features, animations, models, shaders, lighting.

# Libraries & Files
Assets not related directly to scripting are not included in this repository. The project relies on certain commercial assets and plugins such as animancer and DOTween, which are not included in this repository.
